(NASDAQ:PYPL) had plans to enter the cryptocurrency industry, and will soon begin offering cryptocurrency buying and selling functionality.This new feature is likely to have a significant positive impact on the cryptocurrency industry as a whole, but the cryptocurrency trading space looks set to benefit the most.Since most PayPal users have already completed identity verification, and PayPal already has strict fraud detection practices in place, PayPal should be able to offer cheaper, faster access to cryptocurrency than many current vendors.Trading Education Platforms Are Gearing UpThough the cryptocurrency trading industry is set to benefit from PayPal’s impending cryptocurrency on-ramp, there is a strong possibility that cryptocurrency trading and market analytics platforms will also experience a concomitant explosion in interest.This includes the popular cryptocurrency market analysis and trading education platform, NewsCrypto, which recently began accepting PayPal and Mastercard (NYSE:MA) payments for its NWC tokens.</div>                    <div style="float:left;"><span class="bottomticker">MA</span><span class="bottomsearchtext"> finance.yahoo.com | July 23 2020 </span></div>                    <div style="text-align:right;"><span style="font-size:0.9rem;color:#D1D1D1; line-height:1rem ">neutral</span></div>                </div><div class="card">                    <div class="titlesearch"><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wework-said-lose-major-tenant-004500189.html">WeWork Said to Lose Major Tenant in Japan as Rakuten Exits</a></div>                    <div class="textsearch">(Bloomberg) -- WeWork, the troubled co-working giant backed by SoftBank Group Corp., is set to suffer the loss of a major tenant in Japan as Rakuten Inc. exits, according to people familiar with the matter.Spokespersons for Rakuten and WeWork declined to comment.Japan is an important market for WeWork in part because it is home to SoftBank.A month later, SoftBank’s founder Masayoshi Son cited WeWork’s Japanese operations, which were profitable at the time, as the reason he was convinced the business can be turned around.In addition to Rakuten, WeWork Japan is also losing smaller tenants including publisher Kadokawa Corp. and Oyo Hotels, another SoftBank company.</div>                    <div style="float:left;"><span class="bottomticker">MA</span><span class="bottomsearchtext"> finance.yahoo.com | July 22 2020 </span></div>                    <div style="text-align:right;"><span style="font-size:0.9rem;color:#FF0000; line-height:1rem ">negative</span></div>                </div><div class="card">                    <div class="titlesearch"><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mastercard-ma-stock-sinks-market-214509886.html">MasterCard (MA) Stock Sinks As Market Gains: What You Should Know</a></div>                    <div class="textsearch">In that same time, the Business Services sector gained 5.03%, while the S&P 500 gained 5.15%.We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon.MA is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The Financial Transaction Services industry is part of the Business Services sector.The Zacks Industry Rank includes is listed in order from best to worst in terms of the average Zacks Rank of the individual companies within each of these sectors.</div>                    <div style="float:left;"><span class="bottomticker">MA</span><span class="bottomsearchtext"> finance.yahoo.com | July 21 2020 </span></div>                    <div style="text-align:right;"><span style="font-size:0.9rem;color:#25BF00; line-height:1rem ">positive</span></div>                </div>                                                    </div>                            </div>                            <div><br><hr style="width=80%;size=1px;opacity:0.2; background-color:#D3D3D3;border: 0 ;"/></div>                           </div></div>                </section>            </main>                                         <section>                <footer class="site-footer text-light">                <div class="container">                    <div class="site-footer-inner">                        <div class="brand footer-brand" style="margin-top: 0px">                            &nbsp;                        </div>                        <ul class="footer-links list-reset">                            <li>                                <a href="/contact">irenee.jy93@gmail.com</a>                            </li>                        </ul>                        <ul class="footer-social-links list-reset">                        </ul>                        <div class="footer-copyright">Updated on July 29 2020 </div>                    </div>                </div>                </footer>            </section>        </div>    </body>    </html>
